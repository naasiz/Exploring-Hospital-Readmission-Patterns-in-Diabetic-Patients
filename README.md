# Analysis of hospital readmission trends in diabetic patients using Python (pandas, matplotlib)

This project explores whether features like age, gender, and race influence the likelihood of hospital readmission in diabetic patients. The dataset includes anonymized patient records and readmission status.
The goal was to clean and prepare the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and identify patterns that could point to disparities or trends in hospital readmission rates.
